# ðŸš€ Day 13 â€“ Networking Fundamentals: Key Topics Recap

Today, I revised and summarized the foundational networking concepts I've learned so far. Here's a breakdown of each major area covered:

---

## ðŸ›œ What I Learned (Key Topics):

### âœ… IP Addressing & Subnetting
- IP uniquely identifies devices on a network.
- Subnetting divides large networks into smaller segments for better efficiency and security.
- Learned about CIDR, subnet masks, and calculating usable IP ranges.

### âœ… Data Packets
- Data is broken into packets for efficient transmission.
- Packets include headers (IP info), payload (data), and error-checking information.
- Essential in protocols like TCP/IP.

### âœ… OSI & TCP/IP Models
- OSI: 7-layer model explaining how data moves through a network.
- TCP/IP: Practical 4-layer implementation used in real networks.
- Layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Application, etc.

### âœ… Ports & Protocols (TCP, UDP)
- Ports identify specific applications on a device (e.g., port 80 = HTTP).
- TCP = connection-oriented, reliable.
- UDP = connectionless, faster, used in streaming, gaming.

### âœ… DNS & DHCP
- DNS: Translates domain names to IP addresses (e.g., google.com â†’ 142.250.64.78).
- DHCP: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

### âœ… Routers, Switches, Hubs, Repeaters
- Router: Routes data between networks.
- Switch: Connects devices in LAN using MAC addresses.
- Hub: Broadcasts data to all ports (less efficient).
- Repeater: Extends network signal over long distances.

### âœ… Ethernet vs Wi-Fi
- Ethernet: Wired, faster, more secure.
- Wi-Fi: Wireless, more flexible but slightly less reliable.

### âœ… Network Topologies
- How devices are arranged in a network.
- Types: Star, Mesh, Ring, Bus, Hybrid.

### âœ… VLAN & VPN
- VLAN: Virtual LAN, isolates network segments for security/performance.
- VPN: Secure tunnel over the internet to access private resources.

### âœ… Firewalls & Basic Network Security
- Firewalls control incoming/outgoing traffic based on security rules.
- Protects against unauthorized access.

### âœ… Load Balancing & QoS
- Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
- QoS: Prioritizes traffic to ensure performance (e.g., video > email).

### âœ… SSL/TLS (Web Encryption)
- Protocols for securing data over the internet (e.g., HTTPS).
- Prevents eavesdropping and tampering.

### âœ… Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting
- Tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, `Wireshark`.
- Identifies delays, packet loss, and connection issues.

### âœ… IPv4 vs IPv6
- IPv4: 32-bit address (limited ~4.3B devices).
- IPv6: 128-bit (virtually unlimited).
- Subnetting, address format, and need for transition covered.
