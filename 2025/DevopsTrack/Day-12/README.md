# 🚀 Day 12 : Understanding the Purpose of OSI Model & Communication Layers

Today’s deep dive was all about understanding **why networking needs structure**, and how the **OSI model** helps in making communication between systems scalable, reliable, and standardized.

### 🔍 Key Concepts Explored

1. **Pre-network era communication:**
   - Using OS Pipes (e.g., gRPC, message passing)
   - Shared memory (e.g., Chrome tabs)

2. **Why networking became essential:**
   - Needed for scalability & reliability
   - From standalone apps to distributed systems

3. **How computers communicate physically:**
   - Copper wires (RJ-11, RJ-45) using binary signals
   - Encoding: ASCII (English), UTF (Multilingual)
   - Fiber optics transmit binary using light
   - Wi-Fi uses radio frequencies (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz), similar to AM/FM

4. **Networking hardware evolution:**
   - Network Interface Cards (NICs) now soldered in modern systems
   - Repeater → Hub → Switch (evolution of Layer 1 & 2 devices)

5. **Limitations of Layer 1 (Physical Layer):**
   - No way to check if line is busy
   - No access control
   - No unique device identification

6. **CPU basics refresher:**
   - Instruction cycle: Fetch → Decode → Execute → Store
   - Bit = wire signal (1 = ON, 0 = OFF)
   - 32-bit CPU = 2³² possible addresses processed

7. **Why 8 Bits = 1 Byte?**
   - 7 bits encode 94 characters
   - 1 parity bit for error detection → Total = 8 bits
